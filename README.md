* The **Certificate Generator** system is an automated tool designed to create personalized certificates quickly and efficiently. 
It takes user input, such as names or event details, and inserts them into a pre-made certificate template. The system uses tools like **Fitz** and **FPDF** 
to manipulate PDF files and ensure that each certificate is consistently formatted, making it ideal for events, courses, or other occasions where multiple certificates are needed.

* The process is simple: users can either input details manually via a web interface or provide a list of names for batch processing. The system then customizes 
the certificates by placing the text in specific spots on the template, ensuring professional alignment and design. Once completed, the certificates are generated 
as PDF files and made available for download, either individually or as a group.

* This system offers several benefits, including saving time by automating the certificate creation process and ensuring uniformity across all certificates. 
It is user-friendly, scalable for both small and large groups, and provides customization options while maintaining a professional look. 
This makes it a valuable tool for anyone looking to streamline certificate generation.
